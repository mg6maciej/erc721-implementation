# erc721-implementation
If your project requires max 256 non-fungible tokens, this is the implementation you should use as the most gas efficient

Note: This implementation does not contain code related to ERC721Metadata.
It's up to the user to add that to support explorers, exchanges and whatnot.
See [ExampleERC721Metadata.sol](https://github.com/mg6maciej/erc721-implementation/blob/master/test/ExampleERC721Metadata.sol).
